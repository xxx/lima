# Lima for lpc-rs

This is the working lpc-rs port of Lima, based on upstream revision
`eefaff66adcae9b01e16059574c925b0d63e70a1`. The mudlib sources are in `lib/`.

Use `lpc-rs.env` from this checkout's root. It selects distinct nil, preserved
call-out player context, and a 4,000 ms task limit. Its library path is relative
to this directory.

With the lpc-rs checkout beside this one and its CLI built, check a command with:

```sh
../lpc-rs/target/debug/lpc-rs-lpcc -c lpc-rs.env --check lib/cmds/player/mudlist.c
```

The retained player checks compile 65 of 67 player commands and all 12 supporting
targets. Mudlist passes 13 runtime cases using both actual shells. `su` passes
refresh, race-change and password-modal checks; its existing account/character
lookup limitation is recorded in the port notes. Experimental `random2` remains
deferred and `suicide` is disabled upstream.

Wizard directory navigation passes seven cases covering 28 inputs, including
saved directory history and current-file restoration after shell recreation.
Focused checks compile 15 of 81 wizard commands, 5 of 49 transitional commands
and all 9 navigation support targets. The existing root-origin `cd -` edge is
recorded separately in the port notes.

`ls` passes eight cases covering 29 shell inputs and two external calls. Checks
cover flags, metadata and loaded markers, globbing, plain/ANSI output, pipelines
and redirection; all 9 listing support targets compile. Its existing KB arithmetic
and stored plain-mode behavior are recorded in the port notes.

`cat` passes nine cases covering 34 shell inputs, including controls for nil EOF
and absent stdin. File contents, read boundaries, incoming pipelines, stdin
precedence and output redirection pass; all 10 file-output support targets compile.
Fresh transitional checks add only `cat`, with no regressions. Its existing
chunk-cursor omissions and missing current-file fallback are recorded separately.
Full-inventory, wizard/player-command and startup results retain their preceding
scope.

Current compatibility and handoff notes are in the neighboring lpc-rs checkout:
`doc/driver-comparison.md` and `local/lima/compatibility.md`. Temporary test
harnesses and execution logs belong in `/tmp/`. Continue source changes in this
checkout rather than making another source copy under `local/`.
